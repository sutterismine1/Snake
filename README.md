# Snake
 Snake recreated in JavaScript (in progress)
 <hr>
I do not have a domain registered for this project yet. I used local files for the assets however, it should work on download because I used relative paths, i.e. <strong>'\Assets\snake.png'</strong> instead of <strong>'C:\Users\stefa\Programming\Steve's Programming\HTML\Snake\Assets\snake.png'</strong>
